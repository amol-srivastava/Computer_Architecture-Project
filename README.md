<h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
<p>
   In this section, I implemented insertion and searching operations for a binary search tree. I ensured that the program handles duplicate elements gracefully by printing ignored values and displaying the tree level by level after all insertions.

<h2>Graph Representation</h2>
<p>
   Here, I created a program to represent and query weighted undirected graphs. The program prints adjacent vertices and their total bandwidth for given queries, ensuring the vertices are listed in lexicographical order.

<h2>Data Representation</h2>
<p>
   For the final part of the assignment, I converted decimal numbers to 8-bit and 16-bit IEEE-754 floating-point representations. The results for each input number are printed in a precise format.
